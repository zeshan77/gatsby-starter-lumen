I'm Zeshan Khattak, certified laravel developer with experience of full stack web
application developer. I started my career as a PHP Developer after achieving my graduation
degree in computer science with programming as major subject in 2010.

**2010-2013:** After working for 3 years in Pakistan for [Discretelogix Pvt Ltd](https://discretelogix.com) and [Zeropoint.hr](https://zeropoint.hr), I moved to Dubai for getting international exposure.

**2013-2018:** From 2013 - 2018, I worked for [Track24 Pvt Ltd](https://track24.com) in Dubai. Track24 is a small MNC organization that helps governments, banks, oil & gas sectors to track and ensure their employees' safety
through mobile and web applications.

**2018-2019:** In 2018, I had to move to Germany for another sweet challenge and worked there for one year for [AboutYou Gmbh](https://corporate.aboutyou.de/en/). AY is the fastest growing ecommerce company in Europe.

**2019-present:** After working for 10 years in industry, I finally switched to remote work. Initially, it was
challenging for me and my family however I got settled down with it after couple of months. Since then, I'm enjoying it.
